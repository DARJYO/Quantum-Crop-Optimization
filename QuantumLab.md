# Q29 Requirements
Calculate quantities of cabbages, tomatoes, green peppers, and marigolds.

1. My goal is to  calculate the optimal number of cabbages, tomatoes, green peppers, and marigolds based on certain constraints (e.g., garden space, sunlight, water, or profit maximization).

2. Map Variables to Quantum States
Represent each crop as a quantum state or qubit:

|00> = Cabbages
|01> = Tomatoes
|10> = Green Peppers
|11> = Marigolds

Use superposition to explore all possible combinations of crops.

3. Define Constraints as Quantum Gates
Create quantum gates to represent constraints:

Space Constraint: A gate that limits the total number of crops (e.g., only 2 crops can be grown in a given area).
Sunlight Constraint: A gate that ensures crops requiring similar sunlight are grouped together.
Profit Maximization: A gate that optimizes the combination of crops for maximum profit.

4. Quantum Algorithm
Use a quantum algorithm (e.g., Grover's algorithm or QAOA) to find the optimal combination of crops that satisfies the constraints.

For example:

Grover's Algorithm: Search through all possible combinations of crops to find the one that maximizes profit or satisfies the constraints.
QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm): Optimize the crop combination based on a cost function (e.g., profit or resource usage).

5. Measurement
Measure the quantum states to determine the optimal number of cabbages, tomatoes, green peppers, and marigolds.
Interpret the results classically to provide actionable insights (e.g., "Grow 10 cabbages, 5 tomatoes, 3 green peppers, and 2 marigolds").
